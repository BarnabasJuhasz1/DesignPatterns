/**

 Lazy loading is the practice of delaying load or initialization of resources or objects
 until they're actually needed to improve performance and save system resources.

 Lazy loading is essential when the cost of object creation is very high and the use of the object is very rare.
 So this is the scenario where itâ€™s worth implementing lazy loading.
 The fundamental idea of lazy loading is to load object/data when needed.

 There are 4 common implementations of the Lazy Loading pattern:
    1.Virtual proxy
    2.Lazy Initialization
    3.Ghost
    4.Value Holder
